 'Seafoods': 'Acceptable Quality: Nutritionally valuable when from safe, clean sources, rich in protein and healthy fats, but sourcing transparency is important.',
 'Whole Meats': 'Acceptable Quality: Recognizable, high-quality protein source essential for muscle health and overall nutrition. Should be a primary ingredient in dog food.',
 'Natural Additives': 'Acceptable Quality: When derived from recognizable, safe sources, these additives can enhance nutritional value (e.g., vitamins, minerals).',
 'Artificial Colors': 'Poor Quality: Unnecessary, non-nutritive, and associated with potential allergic reactions or hyperactivity in dogs.',
 'Legumes': 'Poor Quality: Linked to increased risk of DCM (dilated cardiomyopathy) in dogs when used as a primary protein source, especially in grain-free diets.',
 'Algae': 'Acceptable Quality: Algae is a natural source of omega-3s and antioxidants, beneficial in small amounts, but should be used carefully due to potential heavy metal contamination.',
 'Meat Meals': 'Poor Quality: Heavily processed, lower-quality protein source that often includes less desirable parts of animals. Lacks transparency and recognizability.',
 'Animal Fat': 'Acceptable Quality: Provides essential fatty acids and energy, but should be identified (e.g., chicken fat), as unnamed sources may indicate lower quality.',
 'Plant Based Fat': 'Acceptable Quality: Provides fatty acids, but is less biologically appropriate than animal fat for dogs. Should be used sparingly.',
 'Nuts': 'Poor Quality: Potential allergen and difficult for dogs to digest; can be high in fat, leading to digestive issues and weight gain.',
 'Natural Preservatives': 'Acceptable Quality: Safer and less likely to cause allergies than artificial preservatives. Look for tocopherols (Vitamin E) or rosemary extract.',
 'Enzymes & Probiotics': 'Acceptable Quality: Promotes digestive health and nutrient absorption, contributing to overall gut health.',
 'Natural Flavors': 'Poor Quality: "Natural" flavors can lack transparency and may come from questionable sources. Avoid unless the source is clearly identified and reputable.',
 'Animal Digest': 'Poor Quality: Highly processed and often sourced from unnamed animals, making it an undesirable flavor enhancer with low nutritional value.',
 'Blood & Plasma': 'Poor Quality: Low-quality, heavily processed by-products used to increase protein content cheaply. Unnecessary in high-quality diets.',
 'Natural Colors': 'Acceptable Quality: Adds no nutritional value but is safer than artificial colors. Still largely unnecessary in dog food.',
 'Fruits & Vegetables': 'Acceptable Quality: Rich in fiber, vitamins, and antioxidants. Whole, recognizable fruits and vegetables are ideal, especially for digestive health.',
 'Roughages': 'Acceptable Quality: Provides dietary fiber to support digestion, but should be from recognizable sources like fruits, vegetables, or whole grains.',
 'Meat Broths': 'Poor Quality: Often low in actual nutritional value and may contain artificial additives or excessive sodium. Should be high-quality and free from artificial flavorings.',
 'Artificial Flavors': 'Poor Quality: Offer no nutritional benefit and may contribute to allergic reactions or food sensitivities in dogs.',
 'Artificial Preservatives': 'Poor Quality: Linked to potential long-term health risks, including cancer. Common artificial preservatives include BHA, BHT, and ethoxyquin.',
 'Barley': 'Acceptable Quality: Provides carbohydrates and fiber, but may be problematic for dogs with grain sensitivities. Should not be a primary ingredient.',
 'Brewers Products': 'Poor Quality: Low-quality by-products of the brewing process. Often used as cheap fillers with limited nutritional value.',
 'Meats': 'Acceptable Quality: Whole, identifiable meats are the highest-quality protein sources for dogs and should be a primary ingredient.',
 'Meat By-Products': 'Poor Quality: Includes lower-quality parts of the animal (e.g., hooves, feathers), lacks transparency, and is generally less digestible and nutritious.',
 'Meat Isolates or Powder': 'Poor Quality: Highly processed and often of questionable quality. May be used to increase protein content but lacks the benefits of whole meats.',
 'Dairy Products': 'Poor Quality: Many dogs are lactose intolerant, leading to digestive upset. Should be used sparingly and from quality sources (e.g., yogurt, cheese) if included.',
 'Rice': 'Acceptable Quality: Provides easily digestible carbohydrates and energy, but should be balanced with high-quality proteins. Suitable for sensitive stomachs.',
 'Artificial Additives': 'Poor Quality: Additives like synthetic flavor enhancers or preservatives have no nutritional value and may cause long-term health issues or allergies.',
 'Wheat, Corn, Soy': 'Poor Quality: Common allergens in dogs and often used as cheap fillers. These ingredients can contribute to food sensitivities and digestive upset.',
 'Oilseed Meals': 'Poor Quality: Often low-quality by-products of the oil industry. While they provide some protein and fat, their heavy processing makes them less desirable.',
 'Human Food Ingredients': 'Acceptable Quality: As long as they are safe for dogs and meet nutritional needs, human-grade ingredients can be a high-quality choice. Transparency is key.',
 'Chia': 'Acceptable Quality: Rich in omega-3s, fiber, and antioxidants, chia seeds are a good addition in moderation for coat health and digestion.',
 'Dried Meats': 'Acceptable Quality: Retains nutritional value and provides a high-protein source, but quality depends on the drying process and meat source.',
 'Peas': 'Poor Quality: Linked to an increased risk of DCM in some dogs when used as a primary ingredient. Should be limited, especially in grain-free diets.',
 'Grain Meals': 'Poor Quality: Highly processed and of lower nutritional value than whole grains. Often used as fillers.',
 'Oilseeds': 'Acceptable Quality: Provide omega-3s and healthy fats but should be used in moderation and sourced from safe, high-quality plants.',
 'Sorghum': 'Acceptable Quality: Gluten-free and rich in nutrients, but should be a secondary ingredient to high-quality animal proteins.',
 'Oats': 'Acceptable Quality: Provides fiber and is generally safe for dogs with grain sensitivities. A good alternative to other grains like wheat or corn.',
 'Quinoa': 'Acceptable Quality: A good source of protein and amino acids but should not be a primary ingredient. Can be used as an alternative to grains for some dogs.',
 'Rye': 'Poor Quality: Can be hard for dogs to digest and is less nutritionally valuable compared to other grains like oats or rice. May cause digestive upset.'}
